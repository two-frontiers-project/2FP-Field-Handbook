# [Setting up a field processing lab](05-setting-up-a-field-processing-lab.md)
### Background
Prior to going out into the field, select and prepare the areas you will need for a smooth and efficient workflow. The four areas described below — prep, sample check-in, processing, and preservation — should be separated whenever possible to reduce cross-contamination and confusion. In small spaces, some functions may be combined, but sterile technique must be maintained. For example, [sample processing and preservation](08-sample-processing-and-preservation.md) can be done at the same table if performed by the same person in immediate sequence, within a clean working field. We recommend a closed-toe shoe-only policy in the processing and preservation areas, and lab coats in the preservation area, especially if working with an open flame.

### BSL-1 Field Laboratory Practices
When operating a field lab, follow Biosafety Level 1 (BSL-1) practices unless your work or permits require higher containment. BSL-1 standards include wearing PPE (lab coat, gloves, eye protection), prohibiting food and drinks in the lab space, decontaminating work surfaces before and after use, and storing reagents and samples in designated clean areas. Most environmental microbial work falls under BSL-1, but confirm whether site-specific regulations require elevated biosafety measures.
Field Lab Stations
1. #### Field sampling prep area
- Prepare an area to assemble field equipment before departure to sampling sites. This space should be separate from sample processing and   preservation areas and large enough to stage both incoming and outgoing gear. Maintain an inventory list here for quick restocking and replacement.
